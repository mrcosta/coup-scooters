# How to run





### assumptions and comments

* I sent the response with the underline in 'fleet_engineers', but a good practice its to use camelCase for rest APIs
* I implemented a greedy solution, but the problem seems to be more complex. Something related operational research.

### possible improvments

* create annotation to validate the values inside the list of the scooters by district, otherwise the application will crash
* logging
